# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
The data analysis project aims to provide insights into a company's sales data over multiple years. The project involves three main analyses:

1. Yearly Sales Analysis:
   - The project will analyze sales data on a yearly basis to identify trends, patterns, and fluctuations in sales performance over time. This analysis will help the company understand how their sales have evolved and whether there are any seasonal trends.

2. Top 10 Customers Analysis:
   - Another key aspect of the project is to identify and analyze the top 10 customers who contribute the most to the company's revenue. This analysis will help the company focus on its most valuable customers and tailor marketing and customer service strategies accordingly.

3. Country-wise Sales Analysis:
   - The project will also break down sales data by country to determine which countries are the most significant markets for the company. By understanding country-wise sales performance, the company can allocate resources effectively and target specific regions for growth.

Overall, this data analysis project will provide actionable insights into the company's sales performance, customer relationships, and global market presence, helping the company make informed decisions to enhance its business strategies.
